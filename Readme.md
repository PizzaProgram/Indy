This is a complex networking component pack for Delphi and Lazarus programming enviroment,
 written in Pascal language.

Delphi comes with it by default, but you should upgrade it, to get latest fixes.

The necessary binary DLL files can be downloaded from here:

 (But you never know, which version is the right one, developers do not ever tell... You should guess + test.)

Auto-installer BAT files are in the **Lib** directory.
